# Generalising experimental results to unseen contexts - Dissertation project

# Reproducible code

The analysis from the dissertation can be reproduced from a capsule on Codeocean http://doi.org/10.24433/CO.4034574.v1. The capsule contains all the figures and tables from the dissertation with the accompanying R-code. 

## How to use this repository

This repository includes the script and the data to reproduce the analysis in my dissertation. The `functions` folder contains the two  algorithmic implementation of the causalMatch procedure. `causalMathFNN.R` implements the procedure without breaking ties and `causalMatchFNN_ties.R` with breaking ties. Note, that the latter is considerably slower.

# Data
The data folder constains the experimenal data from Green and Gerber (2003)
